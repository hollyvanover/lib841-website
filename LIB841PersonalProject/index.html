<p><center> This is the first website that I have ever created. I used HTML and CSS coding to create this webiste.</center></p>

<p><center> I have included additional pages that explain more about me, my family, and my career! I have also included three methods that can be used to connect with me if you so desire! </center>
<p><center>Thank you again for visiting my page!</center></p>
