<p><strong><center>I have always wanted to be a librarian, especially after working in my local public library during my high school and college years.</strong> It sparked my love for books, and I knew that one day I wanted to become a librarian at a school. Even from a young age, I knew that I wanted to be on the same schedule as my kids so we could spend lots of time together! I have been lucky to be in the same school as my children for all of their schooling so far, and I am lucky enough to have my younget son in class next year! </center></p>

<p><center>Below, you will find three links that represent who I am professionally: LiveBinder, MES Library Website, and MES School Website. </center></p>

<p> <center>My LiveBinder link will take you straight to my LiveBinder Portfolio. This is an ongoing portfolio that represents my Rank 1 Graduate Work toward my Library Media Specialist Degree.</center></p>

<p> <center>The link to the MES Library is a Google website I created for my Rank 1 Graduate Course: LIB 841. However, this assignment is super beneficial because my current school does not have a library website. That is something I hope to change in the future when I become the librarian for my school! </center></p>

<p> <center>Lastly, the link to MES website will take you to my school directly. This represents who I am as a teacher, and the vision and mission of our school! </center></p>
